          Master Dan appeared in my life in 2011, when I was working as head of technical service at a well-known company in the city. I remember as if it were yesterday when he entered the store. It was Tuesday morning and he came with his translator, since he didn't speak Spanish.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          When I saw him, I thought: "I'll practice my English, it's been a while since I've done it." He approached my service area, but before speaking, while he was taking his laptop out of his backpack, I approached his translator and asked if he would let me speak in English to practice a little. He said: "Sure, no problem."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          So I greeted him in English and began to ask him what was wrong with his laptop. He mentioned how good it was that there was someone in the company who spoke English and could explain the problem in his language.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I began to examine the laptop and was able to identify the problem. I explained the solution and told him that it would take three days to repair it completely and be ready for pickup.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          While I was explaining, I noticed that he was watching me closely, as if he detected something, but I didn't pay much attention to it.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I told him to come back on Friday with the documentation I had provided him. Looking at me intently, he said: "Of course I'll be back."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          Our conversation ended that Tuesday, I felt very happy to have been able to practice my English. I thought: "The customer left very satisfied."
        </p>

        <h2 class="scroll-animate text-3xl font-bold text-brand-dark font-georgia mt-12 mb-6">Wednesday of Surprises at Work</h2>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          But the next day, Wednesday at 10 in the morning, I was very surprised to see him enter the store again.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I was very surprised and it made me think that maybe I didn't express myself well in English and that's why he was coming back.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          He approached my area again, I greeted him and said: "Sir, I apologize if I didn't express myself well yesterday, because I told you to come back on Friday."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          He said: "Yes, I understood you well, but this morning I'm not here for my laptop. This morning I'm here for you," pointing his finger at me.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I was stunned for a few seconds and said: "Excuse me, sir, what did you say?"
        </p>

        <div class="scroll-animate bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p class="text-blue-800 italic text-lg">
            "As you heard me, I'm here for you," I drew a nervous smile. And he said: "Let me introduce myself, I'm Dan Reynolds, I'm a shaman who performs ayahuasca ceremonies."
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          Honestly, mentally I thought: "This man must be crazy. A shaman? Ayahuasca?"
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          At that time my opinion about shamans and Ayahuasca was extremely negative. I also said mentally: "Poor man, he must be affected in the head from taking that," my expression changed to that of a worried face.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          At that moment Dan said: "Yesterday was Tuesday, and on Tuesday nights I have Ayahuasca ceremonies. In that ceremony, they told me to come for you, that you would be my student, since you are also a shaman."
        </p>

        <h2 class="scroll-animate text-3xl font-bold text-brand-dark font-georgia mt-12 mb-6">Remembering My First Experience</h2>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          Mentally, I screamed "security!" Just then, he asked me: "You've taken ayahuasca, right?"
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I replied: "No." He insisted: "Yes, you have taken it. Remember it, remember it." His insistence was such that, in fact, I remembered it.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I remembered that I had taken it when I was 16 years old. I told him: "I remembered it, and yes, I did it."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          He said: "Very good. Now tell me, what did you see that you couldn't forget to this day? I know what you saw, but I want you to tell me."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I was very surprised and began to think seriously about who this person was. I had seen him yesterday and in less than 24 hours, he was talking to me about these things.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I told him about my first experience and my connection with the jaguar I saw. He told me: "Exactly, you have a connection with the kingdom of jaguars just like me, so you must take ayahuasca with me."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I replied: "No sir."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          After that day, he came to the store every week to invite me to take ayahuasca with him, but my answer was always the same: "I can't, but thank you for the invitation."
        </p>

        <h2 class="scroll-animate text-3xl font-bold text-brand-dark font-georgia mt-12 mb-6">Communication and Messages Through Dreams</h2>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          Months after founding my company and dedicating myself completely to it, I began to have very strange dreams.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          One of them was that I found myself in a ceremonial maloca, sitting on the floor. In the center, there was an altar surrounded by candles and the person in front of me was Dan, who handed me a cup with a brown liquid inside.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I remember that in that dream I realized that I was in an Ayahuasca ritual and that the shaman was Dan.
        </p>

        <h3 class="scroll-animate text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark font-georgia mt-8 mb-4">Sharing the Dream with My Wife</h3>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          The next morning I talked to my wife about that dream and she told me that maybe that person was remembering you. I said: "It could be," and I left it there.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          The following week, I had the same dream again but this time it happened twice that week.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I told my wife again and we both found it very strange. The following week, it happened three times.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          It was becoming a situation that worried me, but with my daily work, I managed to put it aside.
        </p>

        <div class="scroll-animate bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p class="text-purple-800 italic">
            The fourth week was worse, out of seven days, I dreamed about it five nights. When trying to sleep, I saw him giving me that cup of Ayahuasca.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          It was then that I told my wife: "This is too much. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I feel like I have to go see him."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          My wife asked me if I knew where he lived or if I had his phone number to call him.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I told her no, but then I remembered that the second day I met him, he drew me a picture of how to get to his house and for some reason, I kept that drawing in my personal files.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          Upon finding the sketch, my wife asked me: "What will you tell him when you see him? What is the reason for your visit?"
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I thought about it for a moment and remembered that he once mentioned that he always had problems with his internet connection. I told my wife: "That will be the reason for my visit."
        </p>

        <h2 class="scroll-animate text-3xl font-bold text-brand-dark font-georgia mt-12 mb-6">Visiting Dan's House</h2>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          With the sketch in hand, I went to his house. At the building door there was an intercom, and when I pressed the button for his apartment to announce my arrival, I thought: "Will he remember me?"
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I heard his voice saying: "Hello." I said in English: "Hi, Dan. I don't know if you remember me, I'm De..."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          At that moment, he said: "Yes, Denis, come in. I was waiting for you." And me mentally: "What? How was he waiting for me."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          The truth is that it scared me a little. Once in his room, I explained that I remembered that he always had internet problems and that's why I was visiting him, I didn't tell him anything about the dream.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          He said: "Yes, now I have internet problems. I'm glad you came, since internet is very important for me to communicate with friends and family in the United States."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          After leaving everything repaired and ready to use, I told him that the work was done.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          He asked me how much it was for the work and I told him. It was then that he asked me a strange question: "Denis, do you know what day it is today?" I said: "Yes, it's Tuesday." He replied: "Yes, it's ayahuasca ceremony Tuesday."
        </p>

        <h2 class="scroll-animate text-3xl font-bold text-brand-dark font-georgia mt-12 mb-6">A Payment Agreement That Changed My Life</h2>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I said: "Oh!"
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          He told me: "Let's make a deal Denis. I give you 50% now and the other 50% tonight when you come to the ceremony."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          Mentally I thought it would be better to accept, since he still hadn't paid me the 50%, so I said: "Agreed." He gave me the money, I thanked him and left.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          I returned home and told my wife what had happened. She asked me: "Will you go tonight?" I told her: "I don't know."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          In Dan's apartment, my answer was a resounding "no," but once at home with my wife, it became an "I don't know."
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          Hours passed, and something inside me urged me to go. The ceremony was scheduled for 8:30 p.m. and I had to be at the apartment at 7:30 p.m.
        </p>

        <h3 class="scroll-animate text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark font-georgia mt-8 mb-4">Listening to My Inner Voice (Trust Dan)</h3>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          Hours passed and an inner voice told me to go take Ayahuasca, every minute that passed it became more intense.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          Around 5 p.m., I told my wife that I would go, but that I didn't want to go alone. I said: "I want you to come with me, I want you to be by my side in case something goes wrong." She said: "Okay, I'll go with you," and so it was.
        </p>

        <div class="scroll-animate bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p class="text-green-800 italic">
            That night, we went to the apartment and arrived on time. Dan was happy to see me and I wasn't alone. There were more people from the United States with different shamanic abilities. I heard Dan tell them that I was the person he had talked about.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          To my positive surprise, Dan had a very nice area, everything first class, comfort so that you only concentrate on your process with the medicine, everything totally different from what my first experience was when I was 16 years old.
        </p>

        <div class="scroll-animate bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-400 p-6 mb-8">
          <p class="text-amber-800 italic text-lg">
            "Before meeting Dan, I believed that being a shaman was being ignorant, without studies and that's why they believed in spirits and ghosts. But after meeting Dan, I discovered that the ignorant one was me."
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          That night marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life. Dan became not just a teacher, but a bridge to understanding that shamanism and spirituality could coexist with intelligence, education, and modern life. The dreams had been messages, calling me back to a path I had abandoned years before.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          This encounter taught me that sometimes the universe conspires to bring us exactly what we need, even when we think we don't want it. Dan's persistence, combined with the powerful messages coming through dreams, showed me that my calling as a healer was not something I could ignore forever.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-animate mb-6">
          Today, as I continue the work that Dan helped me remember, I understand that every encounter in our lives has a purpose. Some people come to teach us, others to challenge our beliefs, and some, like Dan Reynolds, come to awaken us to our true destiny.
